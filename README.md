# Scale Prediction Model (SPM) for Robust Object Tracking in Surveillance Videos
We've derived a simple model (SPM) for object scale prediction in surveillance videos, and integrated the SPM in various SOTA trackers.
These are Matlab codes for some of the SPM trackers. Technical details are in our ICIP'2018 paper: Exploring Scene Geometry for Scale Adaptive Object Tracking in Surveillance Videos.

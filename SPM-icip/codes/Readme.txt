All SPM trackers are modified from the baseline trackers.
You'll have to download the baseline codes and make sure they run correctly on your computer.
We only provide the modified/added code files for each tracker.
Please follow the instructions in the readme file in each subdirectory to correctly run our SPM trackers.
